/************** 
Some code examples will use Client, others will use Pool. For example, we could have connected to the database using the following code instead:

const { Client } = require('pg');

const client = new Client({
  user: 'vagrant',
  password: '123',
  host: 'localhost',
  database: 'bootcampx'
}); 

Using a Pool is the preferred way to query with node-postgres. A Pool will manage multiple client connections for us which we don't really need to worry about right now. Just know that either could be used, but Pool is preferred.

const { Pool } = require('pg');

const pool = new Pool({
  user: 'vagrant',
  password: '123',
  host: 'localhost',
  database: 'bootcampx'
});

pool.query(`
SELECT students.id as student_id, students.name as name, cohorts.name as cohort
FROM students
JOIN cohorts ON cohorts.id = cohort_id
WHERE cohorts.name LIKE '%${process.argv[2]}%'
LIMIT ${process.argv[3] || 5};
`)
.then(res => {
  res.rows.forEach(user => {
    console.log(`${user.name} has an id of ${user.student_id} and was in the ${user.cohort} cohort`);
  })
